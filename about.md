# Hey

Welcome to my blog. Given time I expect that there will be some brief ramblings on here about stuff I find interesting. I am a final year physics student at Imperial College London so expect to see some stuff about physics.

Aside from that there may be detours into machine learning and artificial intelligence and just the world in general if time allows. This is a partially selfish endeavour to help me understand new and interesting concepts better so I apologise if the posts end up being unreadable at times.

### What I am working

- I am currently wrapping up my master's in Physics with Theoretical Physics. My final year project is concerned with time in quantum mechanics.

### What I'm interested in

- food
- coding
- photography
- reading
- coffee
