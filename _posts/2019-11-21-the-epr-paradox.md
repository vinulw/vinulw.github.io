What are the fundamental conditions on realism? What does it mean for a theory to be considered complete? Is the moon there when nobody looks? These are all questions that have been asked of quantum mechanics. And behind these questions are extraordinary minds, battling it out to prove their view of the world as the fundamental truth.

Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) took it upon themselves to try and challenge one of the most  successful theories of the early 1900's, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. It was probably one of the most important papers of the time, not only because of what it said, but because of the responses to it as well. In fact, it was the pre-cursor to Bell's inequalities as most of our discussion on entanglement (and hence quantum information theory). Given the recent hype around quantum computing, thought it fitting to try and explain briefly one of the thought experiments that to some degree started it all. I wanted to try and explain this crucial precursor to the entire field fairly simply. I think that it is a perfect example of how weird quantum mechanics can be.

## The EPR thought experiment

### Classical Thought Experiment

First, I think it is helpful to look at this argument from a classical (i.e not quantum mechanical) perspective.

Imagine that you have two identical balls you and your friend have two identical balls in an opaque box. You both know for certain that these balls can either be red $R$ or blue $B$.  You also know that they have been identically prepared. They went through the same factory, exactly the same manufacturing procedure, they were even bought at the same time. Hence you can conclude with certainty that they are the same colour even though you have no idea what colour they are.

Now you and your friend go home with your respective boxes (they actually live in a different city they just came to help you out with this experiment). Either way there is no way for you to open the box and your friend to see or even notice that you have opened the box. When you get home you open the box and realise that the ball in your box is red. Therefore, you conclude that the ball your friend has is also red. This is in essence the thought experiment that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used to state that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was incomplete.  Simple, right?

### Going Quantum

Obviously this seems like a fairly simple and obvious given our understanding of the world as a classical system. We are very used to the idea that the colour or *state* that a ball or *system* is not determined by whether or not we are looking at it. However, this is not built into the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Bohr and his proponents argued that the state of a system outside of measurement is meaningless.

Therefore in quantum mechanics each ball is in both the red and blue states simultaneously. There is no real meaning to assigning a specific colour to the ball until it has been measured. But clearly, given the example above, when we measure one ball it should uniquely define the colour of the other one without us measuring it. Completely contradictory to quantum mechanics claiming that without measurement this cannot be specified. Hence EPR argued that quantum mechanics failed to follow this aspect of realism and was therefore incomplete, requiring further 'seperateltlyhidden variables' for full completeness.

## Responses to the EPR thought experiment

The EPR paradox was supposedly a source of heated debate between Bohr (one of the fathers of quantum mechanics) and Einstein. Bohr argued that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, that you cannot define both position and momentum of particles to arbitrary precision, worked around the EPR argument, Einstein disagreed.

One of the most significant developments to this argument happened when Bohm eventually reformulated it in terms of the spin components of molecules. Following Bohm's contribution it took another 15 years, a total of almost 30 years from the initial formulation of the problem, for John Bell to construct his revolutionary response to the EPR problem. I may approach Bell's inequalities separately, however it was profound not least because it brought to question the nature of locality in quantum mechanics.

Locality is the reason why it is important to be far away from your friend when you open the box. We need to make sure you opening the box and observing your ball does not in any way influence the other's. It is actually very closely tied to our notion of causality, or what order events happen in, so the writers of the EPR argument thought it was infallible. Hence why Bell's inequalities have had such a profound effect on modern day quantum mechanics.

The combination of the EPR thought experiment and Bell's inequalities basically provided the foundation for much of the work in quantum information theory, including quantum computation, we see today. This aspect of physics still astounds me, how the ideas of people nearly a century ago are directly influencing some of the most advanced technology today.

If you want to find out more about the EPR thought experiment check out these links:

- [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/) has a much more detailed account of the EPR paradox, it's history and it's relevance to modern day.
- [The EPR paradox, Bell's inequality, and the question of locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3827) by Guy Blaylock is a paper which goes through the EPR paradox and perhaps one of it's most significant outcomes, Bell's inequalities, very well. It assumes at least an introductory knowledge of quantum mechanics. It's a pretty good place to get started if you are interested in some more of the mathematical details.
